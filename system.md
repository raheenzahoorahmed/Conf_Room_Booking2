# Conference Room Booking System

## Problem
Conference room booking is chaoticâ€”people don't know which rooms are available, double-bookings happen, and there's no easy way to reserve a room.

## Solution
A web-based tool where users can:
- View available conference rooms
- Book a room for a specific time slot
- See current bookings

## System Design
- **Frontend (Cloudflare Pages):** Simple web app to display rooms and booking form.
- **Backend (Cloudflare Workers):** API endpoints to list rooms, view bookings, and create bookings.
- **Database (Cloudflare D1, optional):** Stores rooms and bookings for persistence.

### Functional Flow
1. User visits the web app and sees a list of rooms.
2. User selects a room, enters their name, and chooses a time slot to book.
3. The frontend sends the booking request to the backend API.
4. The backend processes the booking (and stores it in D1 if enabled).
5. User receives confirmation of their booking.

### Technical Flow
- Frontend makes HTTP requests to backend API endpoints (`/api/rooms`, `/api/bookings`).
- Backend serves data and processes bookings.
- (Optional) Backend reads/writes to D1 database for persistent storage.
